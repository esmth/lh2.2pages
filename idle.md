# Idle Control
## Valve 
pin 1 - open?

pin 2 - power 12v

pin 3 - close?

## Cold Compensation
command open more when cold

## RPM Compensation
As RPM goes up when not in idle mode, the ecu will command the valve to open proportionally to engine RPM up to aboue 2500 rpm. I think to keep the intake from pulling too much vacuum in decel.
